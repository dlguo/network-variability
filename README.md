# Code for "Examining the Variability in Network Populations and its role in Generative Models"

This is R code for paper "Examining the Variability in Network Populations and its role in Generative Models". This repository provides the code for 

- generating the three network populations used in paper by Barabási–Albert model, forest fire model and stochastic block model
- simulating synthetic networks with generative models
- computing the pairwise dissimilarity of network metrics
- computing the edge existence entropy and geodesic entropy
